# Firefox Auth Bug — Deep Analysis & Resolution Log

> **Status**: **NOT RESOLVED** — Fix deployed but auth failure persists  
> **Affected Browsers**: Firefox (Normal & Dev Edition), Firefox Mobile  
> **Root Cause**: Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) + Total Cookie Protection suspected; however, same-origin proxy fix did not resolve the issue. See Section 11.  
> **Emergency Rollback Commit**: `10729729bc7b78d4b0e61d9ffbe2d0a4e568fd1b`

## 1. Symptom Description

### Primary Symptoms
- **Login works** on initial page load in normal Firefox
- **After staying on the page for ~50+ minutes**, navigating to new tabs/pages fails to load data
- **Reload fixes the issue** immediately
- **Firefox Dev Edition** cannot log in at all (login loop — returns to login page)
- **Chrome works perfectly** — no issues
- Console shows: `Cross-Origin Request Blocked: ... Status code: (null)` + `TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource`

### Secondary Symptoms (Fixed During Diagnosis)
- `onAuthStateChange` never fired `INITIAL_SESSION` in Firefox
- `isLoading` stayed `true` indefinitely in some scenarios
- Constant re-subscription to `onAuthStateChange` suppressed auth events

---

## 2. The Working Baseline (Commit `10729729bc7b78d4b0e61d9ffbe2d0a4e568fd1b`)

### Architecture Overview
The old working code had a simpler auth architecture:

```
AuthProvider.tsx
├── getAccessToken()
│   ├── supabase.auth.getSession() → returns token
│   ├── if expired: supabase.auth.refreshSession() → refresh cross-origin to supabase.co
│   └── fallback: "cookie" sentinel for wallet users
├── Mount effect: getUser() + getSession() + handleGoogleSignIn/handleSession
├── onAuthStateChange: deps = [supabase, isConnected, handleGoogleSignIn]
└── Wallet effect: fetch("/api/user/profile") for wallet auto-login
```

### Why It "Worked" (Most of the Time)
1. **No proactive timeout wrappers** — Supabase calls ran to completion naturally
2. **`getUser()` on mount** — This validated the token server-side and triggered a refresh if needed. Being a single call at mount, it had lower chance of hitting the Firefox block.
3. **Tab stayed active** — If the user kept the tab active, the auto-refresh timer fired successfully (not blocked by tracking protection because the request wasn't classified as "background tracker" while tab was foreground)
4. **Luck** — The refresh often completed before Firefox's tracking protection heuristics kicked in

### Why It Was Actually Broken (Just Less Noticeably)
- The old code **was still vulnerable** to the same Firefox blocking issue
- It just manifested less frequently because:
  - `getUser()` at mount sometimes succeeded
  - Users often reloaded the page before the session expired
  - Chrome users never saw the issue, masking the cross-browser incompatibility

---

## 3. The Failed Fixes (What Didn't Work & Why)

### Attempt 1: Adding `withTimeout()` to Supabase Auth Calls
**Code added**:
```ts
const { data } = await withTimeout(supabase.auth.getSession(), 8000, "getSession");
const { data: refreshed } = await withTimeout(supabase.auth.refreshSession(), 8000, "refreshSession");
```

**Why it failed**:  
Supabase's `@supabase/gotrue-js` uses the **Web Locks API** internally to serialize auth operations. When `withTimeout()` rejected after 8 seconds, the Promise was abandoned but the underlying lock holder continued running. All subsequent `getSession()`/`refreshSession()` calls queued behind the zombie lock and also timed out. This caused a **cascading deadlock** where auth permanently broke until reload.

**Lesson**: Never timeout Promises that hold OS-level locks (Web Locks, IndexedDB transactions, etc.). The timeout rejects the consumer but doesn't release the lock.

---

### Attempt 2: Replacing `getUser()` with `getSession()` on Mount
**Code change**:
```ts
// Old: const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
// New: const { data: { session } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
```

**Why it helped but didn't fix the root cause**:  
`getUser()` makes a cross-origin network request to validate the token. `getSession()` reads from cookies locally. Removing `getUser()` reduced cross-origin requests at mount, which helped with initial load. But it didn't address the **auto-refresh timer** that still fired cross-origin requests after ~50 minutes.

---

### Attempt 3: Stabilizing `onAuthStateChange` with Refs
**Code added**:
```ts
const isConnectedRef = useRef(isConnected);
const handleGoogleSignInRef = useRef(handleGoogleSignIn);
// Subscription deps: [supabase] only
```

**Why it helped but wasn't the root cause**:  
This fixed a React effect re-subscription bug where `onAuthStateChange` was recreated constantly, suppressing `INITIAL_SESSION`. This was a **real bug** that caused login issues in some scenarios, but not the "works for 50 minutes then breaks" issue.

---

### Attempt 4: Adding Tab Visibility Recovery with `refreshSession()`
**Code added**:
```ts
// On tab visible after 60s idle:
await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
const probeRes = await fetchWithTimeout("/api/user/profile");
```

**Why it made things worse**:  
If the network was slow, `refreshSession()` held the Supabase auth lock for seconds. If the user navigated to a new page during this time, `getSession()` blocked waiting for the lock. The UI hung until reload.

**Lesson removed**: The final fix removes `refreshSession()` from the visibility handler entirely.

---

### Attempt 5: Adding `credentials: "same-origin"` to Fetch Calls
**Code added**:
```ts
return await fetch(input, { credentials: "same-origin", ...init, signal: controller.signal });
```

**Why it didn't fix the core issue**:  
This ensured cookies were sent with API calls, which was a valid fix for a different bug (wallet auth not sending cookies). But it doesn't affect Supabase's internal `refreshSession()` call, which is made by the Supabase client itself, not our `fetch` wrapper.

---

## 4. The Correct Fix (Current Implementation)

### Core Insight
**Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection + Total Cookie Protection categorizes `*.supabase.co` as a tracker domain.** Cross-origin requests to tracker domains are silently blocked when:
- The tab has been idle for a while
- The request fires from a background tab
- Firefox Dev Edition's stricter heuristics trigger

The error signature is diagnostic:
```
Status code: (null)
Reason: CORS request did not succeed
TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource
```

A **real** CORS error shows an HTTP status (like 403) or a preflight failure. `(null)` means the browser **never sent the request** — it was killed by tracking protection.

### The Solution: Same-Origin Refresh Proxy

#### File 1: `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts` (NEW)
A server-side proxy that calls `supabase.auth.refreshSession()` using the server-side Supabase client (`@supabase/ssr`'s `createServerClient`). Server-to-Supabase requests are **never** blocked by browser tracking protection.

```ts
// Browser (same-origin) → /api/auth/refresh → Server → Supabase
//                                    ↑
//                     Firefox allows this (same-origin)
```

#### File 2: `app/utils/supabase/supabaseClient.ts` (MODIFIED)
Disabled `autoRefreshToken: false` in the browser client. This stops the background cross-origin timer that Firefox blocks.

```ts
auth: {
  autoRefreshToken: false, // ← was implicitly true before
},
```

#### File 3: `components/AuthProvider.tsx` (MODIFIED)
Updated `getAccessToken()` to call `/api/auth/refresh` instead of `supabase.auth.refreshSession()`:

```ts
// Old (cross-origin, blocked by Firefox):
const { data: refreshed } = await supabase.auth.refreshSession();

// New (same-origin, bypasses Firefox blocklist):
const res = await fetchWithTimeout("/api/auth/refresh", { method: "POST" });
const refreshed = await res.json();
return refreshed.access_token;
```

### Supporting Fixes (Also Applied)
1. **Removed `refreshSession()` from tab visibility handler** — prevents lock contention
2. **Added 3-second UI safety timeout on mount** — unblocks the page if `getSession()` hangs on a cross-tab lock
3. **Removed `withTimeout()` from Supabase auth calls** — prevents zombie lock holders
4. **Stabilized `onAuthStateChange` subscription** — `[supabase]` deps only, callbacks via refs

---

## 5. Comparison: Old vs. Current Architecture

| Aspect | Old (`10729729`) | Current (Fixed) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Mount hydration** | `getUser()` + `getSession()` | `getSession()` + `/api/user/profile` probe |
| **Token refresh** | `supabase.auth.refreshSession()` (cross-origin) | `/api/auth/refresh` (same-origin proxy) |
| **Auto-refresh timer** | Enabled (implicit `autoRefreshToken: true`) | Disabled (`autoRefreshToken: false`) |
| **onAuthStateChange deps** | `[supabase, isConnected, handleGoogleSignIn]` | `[supabase]` only (refs for callbacks) |
| **Tab visibility handler** | None | Re-probes profile (no `refreshSession()`) |
| **Safety timeout** | None | 3s UI unblock + 10s auth fallback |
| **Firefox ETP resilience** | Vulnerable (masked by luck) | Explicitly bypassed via same-origin proxy |

---

## 6. Why Sleep Mode Is a Red Herring

The user noted that network errors could be from the computer going to sleep. Here's why the sleep hypothesis doesn't match the evidence:

| Sleep Mode | Firefox ETP Block |
|------------|-------------------|
| Affects **all** network requests indiscriminately | Only affects **cross-origin requests to tracker domains** |
| Error would show `ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED` or `NS_ERROR_NET_TIMEOUT` | Error shows `Status code: (null)` + `CORS request did not succeed` |
| Recovery is automatic when network returns | Requires reload to reset Supabase client state |
| Would affect Chrome too | Only affects Firefox |
| Timing is random (whenever sleep occurs) | Timing is consistent (~50 min = token expiry) |

**Conclusion**: Sleep might cause occasional network errors, but the consistent "after some minutes" pattern with `(null)` status is definitively Firefox tracking protection.

## 7. Testing Checklist for Deployment Verification

### Normal Firefox
- [ ] Log in with Google
- [ ] Stay on page for 60+ minutes (or manually expire session cookie)
- [ ] Navigate to new pages/tabs — data should load
- [ ] No `Status code: (null)` errors in console

### Firefox Dev Edition
- [ ] Log in with Google
- [ ] Should not loop back to login page
- [ ] Session should persist across page reloads

### Regression Tests
- [ ] Chrome still works (no changes to Chrome behavior)
- [ ] Wallet login still works
- [ ] Google + wallet linking still works
- [ ] Logout works for both auth methods
- [ ] Session refresh happens transparently during API calls

## 8. Lessons for Future AI Agents

1. **Never wrap lock-holding Promises with `Promise.race`/timeout** — creates zombie lock holders
2. **Status `(null)` + `NetworkError` in Firefox = tracking protection, not CORS** — look for the `(null)` status
3. **Cross-origin auth refresh is fragile in Firefox** — always prefer same-origin proxies for auth operations
4. **Disable `autoRefreshToken` when using cookie-based auth with Supabase SSR** — proactive refresh in `getAccessToken()` is more reliable
5. **Firefox != Chrome** — always test auth flows in both; Chrome's permissive defaults hide privacy-related bugs
6. **The old code wasn't truly "working"** — it was just lucky. Don't assume the baseline is bug-free.

---

## 9. Files Changed in This Fix

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts` | **NEW** — Same-origin refresh proxy |
| `app/utils/supabase/supabaseClient.ts` | Added `autoRefreshToken: false` + `cookieOptions` |
| `components/AuthProvider.tsx` | Proxy refresh in `getAccessToken()`, stabilized subscription, removed `withTimeout` from auth calls, added UI safety timeouts, removed `refreshSession()` from visibility handler |
| `app/social/SocialPageClient.tsx` | Skip `Authorization` header when `token === "cookie"` |

---

## 10. Post-Deployment Verification — Fix FAILED

### Symptoms After Deploying the Same-Origin Proxy Fix

**Date reported**: 2026-04-22  
**Environment**: Production (`estories.app`), Firefox 149.0 (Windows), Firefox Dev Edition  
**User state**: Logged in with Google OAuth (cookie `sb-qfwhtsmqndnocfidhdhy-auth-token` present in request)

#### Symptom 1: `/api/user/profile` returns 401
```
GET https://estories.app/api/user/profile
Status: 401 Unauthorized
```

**Request headers show the Supabase auth cookie IS being sent**:
```
Cookie: sb-qfwhtsmqndnocfidhdhy-auth-token=base64-eyJhY2Nlc3NfdG9rZW4iOiJleUpoYkdjaU9pSklVekkxTmlJc0ltdHBaQ0k2SW1SeFNsUkVPRUpMTjFCaWFraDJTamdpTENKMGVYQWlPaUpLVjFRaWZRLmV5SnBjM01pT2lKb2RIUndjem92TDNGbWQyaDBjMjF4Ym1SdWIyTm1hV1JvWkdoNUxuTjFjR0ZpWVhObExtTnZMMkYxZEdndmRqRWlMQ0p6ZFdJaU9pSTJPR0l3TkdVek9DMWhZMk0yTFRRMU5tRXRPRGs0T1MxbU56WmxPVGxsTkRRME5HSWlMQ0poZFdRaU9pSmhkWFJvWlc1MGFXTmhkR1ZrSWl3aVpYaHdJam94TnpjMk9EWTJPVEk0TENKcFlYUWlPakUzTnpZNE5qTXpNamdzSW1WdFlXbHNJam9pY21WdGVXOXlaVzh4TVVCbmJXRnBiQzVqYjIwaUxDSndhRzl1WlNJNk…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
```

The cookie is present, same-origin, and the request reaches the server. Yet the server responds with **401**. This means:
- **Firefox ETP is NOT blocking the request** — the request arrives at the server (HTTP/2 401, not `(null)` status).
- **The cookie value is either expired, malformed, or the server-side validation is failing** for a different reason.

#### Symptom 2: Infinite Loading on Navigation
- Navigate to any data-fetching tab (e.g., `/tracker`, `/library`, `/social`)
- Page shows loading spinner **indefinitely**
- **Reloading the page fixes it immediately**
- This happens consistently in both normal Firefox and Firefox Dev Edition

#### Symptom 3: Firefox Dev Edition Behavior Unchanged
- Dev Edition still exhibits the same login loop / auth failure pattern
- No improvement after the same-origin proxy fix

### Critical Insight: The Error Changed

| Before Fix | After Fix |
|------------|-----------|
| `Status code: (null)` + `NetworkError` | `HTTP/2 401` |
| Cross-origin `refreshSession()` blocked | Same-origin request **arrives** at server |
| Firefox never sent the request | Firefox **sent** the request with cookie |

**Conclusion**: The same-origin proxy successfully bypassed Firefox's cross-origin blocking, but the underlying auth mechanism is still broken. The problem is now server-side: the Supabase auth cookie is being transmitted but not validated correctly by the API middleware.

---

## 11. What Has Been Tried (And Failed)

| Attempt | What Was Changed | Result |
|---------|------------------|--------|
| Same-origin refresh proxy | `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts` + `autoRefreshToken: false` | Request reaches server but still 401s |
| Proactive `getAccessToken()` refresh | `AuthProvider.tsx` calls `/api/auth/refresh` before API calls | Cookie present but invalid/expired |
| `credentials: "same-origin"` on fetch | All `apiGet`/`apiPost` calls | Did not affect cookie validation |
| Stabilized `onAuthStateChange` | `[supabase]` deps only | No impact on the 401 issue |
| Removed `withTimeout` from auth calls | Prevents zombie Web Locks | No impact on the 401 issue |

---

## 12. New Hypotheses (For the Next Agent)

### Hypothesis A: Cookie Expiry / Clock Skew
The base64 cookie contains an `expires_at` field. If the server clock and client clock diverge, or if the cookie expires between the client reading it and the server validating it, the server rejects it. **However**, a page reload fixes it, which suggests the cookie is re-read/re-validated successfully on reload.

### Hypothesis B: Supabase SSR Cookie Parsing Bug
`@supabase/ssr` parses cookies differently on the client vs. server. The client may be sending a cookie that the server-side `createServerClient` cannot decode properly. The cookie name contains the project ref (`sb-qfwhtsmqndnocfidhdhy-auth-token`) — verify that the server-side client is looking for the **exact same cookie name**.

### Hypothesis C: `getAccessToken()` Returns Stale / Wrong Token
`getAccessToken()` in `AuthProvider.tsx` may be returning an expired token from `supabase.auth.getSession()` (client-side cache) even after the same-origin refresh "succeeds." The client-side token and the cookie token may be out of sync.

### Hypothesis D: API Route Middleware Bug
`validateAuthOrReject()` in API routes may be failing to extract or validate the cookie correctly. Check:
- Does `createSupabaseAdminClient()` or `createServerClient()` in the API route read the cookie from `cookies()` correctly?
- Is the cookie being parsed as base64-decoded JSON correctly?
- Does `cookies()` from `next/headers` return the cookie when the request is made client-side via `fetch`?

### Hypothesis E: React Query Cache + Auth Race
React Query hooks fire immediately on mount. If `getAccessToken()` is called before `AuthProvider` has finished its mount hydration, the token may be `null` or stale. The component shows "loading" forever because the 401 response is not handled (no error UI — just infinite spinner).

**Evidence for Hypothesis E**: The infinite loading only happens on *navigation* (client-side routing), not on full page reload. On reload, the server renders the page and `AuthProvider` hydrates before React Query fires. On navigation, React Query may fire before auth is ready.

---

## 13. Recommended Diagnostic Steps for Next Agent

1. **Add server-side logging** to `/api/user/profile` and `/api/auth/refresh`:
   - Log what cookies are received (`console.log(cookies().getAll())`)
   - Log what `supabase.auth.getUser()` returns (or if it throws)
   - Log the decoded cookie structure (is `access_token` present and non-empty?)

2. **Add client-side logging** to `AuthProvider.tsx`:
   - Log the output of `getAccessToken()` before every API call
   - Log `document.cookie` to verify the browser actually has the cookie
   - Log `supabase.auth.getSession()` vs. `supabase.auth.getUser()` divergence

3. **Test the cookie directly**:
   - In Firefox DevTools, copy the cookie value and base64-decode it
   - Check `expires_at` — is it in the past?
   - Check `access_token` — is it present and looks like a valid JWT?

4. **Test the API route in isolation**:
   - Use `curl` with the cookie to call `/api/user/profile`
   - If `curl` works but browser `fetch` doesn't, it's a cookie/header issue
   - If `curl` also 401s, the cookie value itself is invalid

5. **Check React Query error handling**:
   - The infinite loading suggests React Query hooks are NOT handling 401 errors
   - Add `throwOnError: true` or `error` state rendering to see if queries are failing silently
   - Check if `useAuth()` returns `isLoading: true` indefinitely during navigation

6. **Verify the server-side Supabase client config**:
   - In `lib/supabase/server.ts` (or wherever `createServerClient` is configured), ensure `cookieOptions` match the client-side config exactly
   - Ensure the server client is configured with the same `auth.flowType` (pkce) and `auth.detectSessionInUrl` settings

---

## 14. Files That Must Be Examined

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `components/AuthProvider.tsx` | `getAccessToken()` may return stale token; mount hydration may race with React Query |
| `app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts` | May not be correctly refreshing the cookie or may be returning an expired token |
| `app/api/user/profile/route.ts` | Server-side cookie validation is failing — add logging here |
| `lib/supabase/server.ts` (or equivalent) | Server-side `createServerClient` config must match client config |
| `lib/api.ts` | `apiGet`/`apiPost` may not be handling 401s or token refresh correctly during navigation |
| `app/utils/supabase/supabaseClient.ts` | Browser client config; verify `cookieOptions` and `auth` settings |

---

## 15. Emergency Rollback

The emergency rollback commit `10729729bc7b78d4b0e61d9ffbe2d0a4e568fd1b` is always available via:
```bash
git checkout 10729729bc7b78d4b0e61d9ffbe2d0a4e568fd1b -- components/AuthProvider.tsx
```

**Note**: The old code had the same Firefox issues, just masked by luck. Rolling back is a temporary measure, not a fix.

---

## 16. Post-Deployment Catastrophic Failure — 2026-04-22

> **CRITICAL**: The current deployed code has made the auth situation **worse** than before the fix. Do not attempt further auth fixes without reading this section completely.

### New Severity
- **Normal Firefox** (not just Dev Edition) now **cannot log in** — login succeeds briefly then immediately logs out on navigation or reload
- **Previously**: Normal Firefox worked for ~50 min, Dev Edition was broken
- **Now**: Both normal Firefox and Dev Edition are broken immediately after login

### Timeline of Failure (User-Observed)

1. **User logs in** (Google OAuth)
2. **Initial landing page loads correctly** — no 401s, authenticated data is fetched successfully
3. **User navigates to a new tab** (e.g., `/library`, `/social`, `/story/[id]`)
4. **UI briefly shows "Connect" / logged-out state** — as if auth was lost
5. **Then console floods with 401 errors** on ALL API endpoints:
   ```
   GET /api/user/profile → 401
   GET /api/stories → 401
   GET /api/stories/collections → 401
   GET /api/social/follow?followed_ids=... → 401
   GET /api/social/like/status?story_ids=... → 401
   ```
6. **Story page loads infinitely** (spinner never stops)
7. **Reloading the page does NOT fix it** — user remains logged out
8. **Re-logging in also fails** — the cycle repeats

### Critical Observations

#### A. The Cookie IS Present
Request headers show the Supabase auth cookie `sb-qfwhtsmqndnocfidhdhy-auth-token` is being sent with the 401 requests. The server receives the cookie but rejects it.

#### B. Auth Works Initially, Then Collapses
The fact that authenticated data loads **correctly immediately after login** proves:
- The cookie is valid at the moment of login
- The server CAN validate the cookie
- The React Query hooks CAN fetch authenticated data

The collapse happens **on client-side navigation**, not on initial server render. This is a **massive clue**.

#### C. "Connect" State Appears Before 401s
The UI briefly shows the logged-out "Connect" state when navigating. This suggests `useAuth()` is returning `null` for `profile` during navigation, which causes:
1. Components to render logged-out UI
2. React Query hooks to still fire (because they're not gated by auth state)
3. API calls to go out with a stale/invalid token → 401

#### D. Story Page Infinite Loading
The story page loading spinner never stops. This suggests:
- `useStory(storyId)` is in `isLoading: true` state
- Either the 401 is not being caught as an error, OR
- The query is retrying indefinitely, OR
- `isLoading` is derived from something that never flips (e.g., `isAuthLoading` from `useAuth()` stuck true)

### What Changed That Made It Worse?

The only auth-related changes between "old buggy but semi-working" and "now completely broken" are:

1. **`autoRefreshToken: false`** in `supabaseClient.ts` — stops background refresh
2. **`getAccessToken()` calls `/api/auth/refresh`** instead of `supabase.auth.refreshSession()`
3. **Removed `refreshSession()` from tab visibility handler**
4. **React Query migrations** in `SocialPageClient`, `LibraryPageClient`, `StoryPageClient`, `ProfilePageClient`, `RecordPageClient` — added `useQuery` hooks that call APIs immediately on mount

**Hypothesis: The React Query migration introduced a race condition.**

Before the migration, pages used `useEffect` + `fetch` inside the component. The `useEffect` ran AFTER React's render cycle, giving `AuthProvider`'s mount effect time to finish. After migration, `useQuery` hooks execute during render (or at least earlier in the lifecycle), firing API calls before `AuthProvider` has finished hydrating the session.

When the user navigates client-side:
1. Next.js unmounts the old page, mounts the new page
2. New page's `useQuery` hooks fire immediately
3. `getAccessToken()` runs, but `AuthProvider` may be in a transient state
4. The token returned is stale/expired/null
5. API returns 401
6. `AuthProvider` sees 401s and assumes the user is logged out
7. Auth state resets to null
8. All subsequent API calls also 401

**This creates a death spiral**: React Query fires → 401 → AuthProvider clears session → more 401s → UI shows logged out.

### Why Reload Doesn't Fix It

If the cookie itself is valid, why does reload not fix it? Possible explanations:
1. The server-side render on reload ALSO gets a 401 (cookie is valid but SSR supabase client can't read it)
2. The `AuthProvider` mount effect is now broken (possibly due to `autoRefreshToken: false` changes)
3. Something in the new `getAccessToken()` path permanently corrupts the cookie/session

### The IndexedDB Error
```
Analytics SDK: Error: IndexedDB:Set:InternalError
```
This is a **Sentry/analytics SDK error**, likely unrelated to the auth bug. However, if the IndexedDB error is from Supabase's own storage (not Sentry), it could indicate that Supabase's client-side session storage is failing. Verify which SDK this error comes from.

### Previous "Fix" Files That May Have Caused Regression

| File | Change | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| `app/utils/supabase/supabaseClient.ts` | `autoRefreshToken: false` | **HIGH** — Stops all background refresh. If proactive refresh in `getAccessToken()` fails, session dies permanently |
| `components/AuthProvider.tsx` | `getAccessToken()` calls `/api/auth/refresh` | **HIGH** — New code path, untested in production. May return wrong token or corrupt cookie |
| `components/AuthProvider.tsx` | Removed `refreshSession()` from visibility handler | **MEDIUM** — Removed a recovery path |
| `lib/queries/hooks.ts` | Added `useUserStories`, `useStory`, `useLikeStatus`, etc. | **HIGH** — These hooks fire immediately on navigation, racing with auth hydration |
| Multiple pages | Replaced `useEffect` + `fetch` with `useQuery` | **HIGH** — Changed execution timing of data fetching relative to auth initialization |

### What Must NOT Be Changed Without Extreme Care

1. **`components/AuthProvider.tsx`** — This is the auth brain. Any change here affects ALL users, ALL auth methods (Google + wallet), ALL pages.
2. **`app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`** — Server-side cookie handling. A bug here could corrupt cookies for all users.
3. **`app/utils/supabase/supabaseClient.ts`** — Browser client config. Changing `autoRefreshToken` back to `true` without understanding the full implications could re-introduce the Firefox ETP bug.
4. **Any database schema or user table migrations** — There are registered users. Do not touch `users` table, `unlocked_content`, `payments`, or any table with production data.
5. **Payment/web3 flows** — `useStoryProtocol`, `useEStoryToken`, `useStoryNFT` hooks. Do not change these.

### Recommended Immediate Diagnostic Actions (Read-Only / Logging Only)

1. **Add console logging to `getAccessToken()`** in `AuthProvider.tsx`:
   ```ts
   console.log("[getAccessToken] called");
   console.log("[getAccessToken] session:", session?.access_token?.slice(0,10));
   console.log("[getAccessToken] refresh response:", refreshed?.access_token?.slice(0,10));
   ```

2. **Add console logging to API route `/api/auth/refresh`**:
   ```ts
   console.log("[/api/auth/refresh] cookies:", cookies().getAll().map(c => c.name));
   console.log("[/api/auth/refresh] refresh result:", data);
   ```

3. **Add console logging to `/api/user/profile`**:
   ```ts
   console.log("[/api/user/profile] cookies:", cookies().getAll().map(c => c.name));
   console.log("[/api/user/profile] auth result:", authResult);
   ```

4. **Add React Query `onError` logging** in `lib/api.ts`:
   ```ts
   console.error("[API] 401 on:", endpoint, "token prefix:", token?.slice(0,10));
   ```

5. **Verify `/api/auth/refresh` is actually being called** during navigation:
   - The user reports 401s on ALL APIs
   - If `getAccessToken()` is working, `/api/auth/refresh` should be called before each API
   - If it's NOT being called, the proactive refresh isn't firing

### Nuclear Option (If Nothing Else Works)

If the auth system cannot be fixed safely, the safest path is:
1. **Rollback `components/AuthProvider.tsx`** to the pre-fix state (commit before the same-origin proxy was added)
2. **Keep the React Query migrations** (they're not the root cause, just exposing it faster)
3. **Accept that Firefox ETP will still be an issue** until a proper fix is designed

**DO NOT attempt to fix both the auth race condition AND the Firefox ETP issue in the same deployment.** These are two different bugs that got tangled together.
