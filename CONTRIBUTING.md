## First steps

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/web3_Ai_iStory.git
cd i_story_dapp
```

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or: yarn install / pnpm install
```

1. Create a branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-short-description
```

## How to contribute

- Open an issue first for major features or breaking changes to discuss design and scope.
- For small fixes (typos, docs, small bugfixes), open a pull request directly referencing the issue (if any).
- Keep PRs focused and small — one logical change per PR.

## Branching & commit messages

- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`.
- Use Conventional Commits style for commit messages. Example:

```text
feat(record): add real-time transcription indicator
fix(api): handle empty audio uploads gracefully
docs: update contributing guidelines
```

## Code style & linting

- The project uses TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. Run lint and format before submitting:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
# format as required by the repo (Prettier integration if available)
```

- Keep changes aligned with existing patterns (React + Next.js App Router, Tailwind classes, shadcn/ui components).

## Testing locally

- Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Run lint checks:

```bash
npm run lint
```

- If running end-to-end tests are added, use Playwright:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Add tests where applicable and ensure existing tests pass.

## Pull request checklist

Before requesting review, ensure:

- [ ] Code builds and runs locally
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`) and formatting is applied
- [ ] Tests added/updated where relevant and passing
- [ ] PR description explains the *why* and *what* (include screenshots for UI changes)
- [ ] Any required environment variables or setup steps documented

## Security issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead email the maintainers at `security@istory.app` with details so we can triage and patch privately.

## Communication

- For questions and community discussion: join the project's Discord or GitHub Discussions (see `README.md` for links).
- Keep interactions respectful and follow the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` included in the repository.
