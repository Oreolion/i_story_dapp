// ============================================================================
// FAQ Data
// ============================================================================

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What can I write about on eStories?",
    answer:
      "Anything you're passionate about! eStories is a storytelling platform, not just a journal. Write personal reflections, historical narratives, geopolitical analysis, cultural stories, creative non-fiction, memoirs, travel writing, or anything else. Private stories stay encrypted in your vault; public stories can earn tips and paywall revenue.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the AI analysis help me become a better writer?",
    answer:
      "Every story you write gets analyzed for narrative coherence, emotional depth, thematic consistency, and significance. The AI provides a brief insight about your story's meaning and actionable advice on how to improve. Over time, you can track your storytelling progress as your scores improve. Think of it as a writing coach that learns your patterns.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data private and secure?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Private stories are encrypted with AES-256-GCM in your browser before storage — we literally cannot read them. Your encryption key is derived from your PIN and never leaves your device. For public stories, Chainlink CRE provides verifiable AI analysis without exposing your raw data on-chain. Only cryptographic proofs go to the blockchain.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a crypto wallet to use eStories?",
    answer:
      "No! You can sign up with Google OAuth or create an account with email. A crypto wallet is optional — it unlocks Web3 features like tipping, paywalls, NFT book minting, and on-chain story provenance. You can add a wallet anytime from your profile settings.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are $STORY tokens used for?",
    answer:
      "$STORY is an ERC-20 token on Base (Ethereum L2) used for the creator economy: readers tip writers, unlock paywalled stories, and mint story collections as NFTs. Token transactions are fast and low-cost thanks to Base's L2 efficiency. You don't need tokens to read free public stories or write your own.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is CRE-verified quality?",
    answer:
      "Chainlink CRE (Compute Runtime Environment) runs AI analysis across multiple independent nodes inside encrypted enclaves. The nodes reach consensus, and a cryptographic proof is written on-chain. This means quality ratings on paywalled stories are verifiable and tamper-proof — readers can trust the quality score before purchasing.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I publish stories about history, politics, or culture?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely — that's a core use case. eStories is designed for all forms of storytelling. Historical essays, geopolitical analysis, and cultural narratives are especially well-suited for public publishing with paywalls. The on-chain provenance proves a human wrote the story at a specific time, which has archival and journalistic value.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do story collections work?",
    answer:
      "You can group related stories into collections — like a series on \"The History of West African Trade Routes\" or \"My Year Living Abroad.\" You can also continue an existing story, creating a linked narrative thread. Collections can be minted as NFT books on the blockchain.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I switch plans or cancel anytime?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your plan at any time. If you cancel, you keep access until the end of your billing period. Your stories are always yours — they stay in your encrypted vault regardless of your plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to my stories if eStories shuts down?",
    answer:
      "Your private stories live in your browser's encrypted local vault — they exist on your device, not our servers. Public stories published on-chain have permanent blockchain provenance. Audio files are stored on IPFS (decentralized storage). eStories is designed so your content survives independent of the platform.",
